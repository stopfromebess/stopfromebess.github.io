<h1>BESS Technology</h1>

<p>The fire safety of Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) has become a growing concern due to around 70 fire-related
    incidents since 2012, 60 since 2018
    [<a href="https://storagewiki.epri.com/index.php/BESS_Failure_Event_Database" target="_blank">BESS Failure Event
        Database</a>]
</p>

<p>The rapid expansion of BESS projects and the supporting industry has led to an increase in concerns, as the
    occurrence of fire incidents has also escalated. BESS fires can pose a significant safety risk to the area
    surrounding the BESS installation, posing a human safety risk from the fire and products of the fire and a risk to
    the environment.</p>
<p>Whilst safer than some other forms of Lithium Ion battery, Lithium Iron Phosphate batteries (LFP) can and do ignite
    and are subject to thermal runaway. LFP Battery fires not only pose a risk through the fire itself and the
    challenges of containing/extinguishing, but also the production of toxic gases, including carbon monoxide (CO) and
    hydrogen fluoride (HF)(Liu, P., et al., 2020. Thermal runaway and fire behaviors of lithium iron phosphate battery
    induced by over-heating. Journal of Energy Storage, 31, p.101714.)</p>
<p>The Trina Solar UK Holdco Ltd Planning Statement for the proposed Frome Power - Energy Storage Facility, provides a
    general description of the fire detection and fire prevention equipment to be installed, although the loose
    reference to meeting international standards is less than adequate.Smoke detection and inert gas fire suppression
    mechanisms are not currently deemed best practice and there is no information on how reliably these would operate in
    the event of fire - particularly a thermal runaway that in one cell, leading to a domino effect within the battery,
    potentially leading to explosion. As the battery size increases, the likelihood of a more severe fire also rises. In
    the event that a battery fire is extinguished, there are still significant potential hazards, including secondary
    fire, deflagration and toxic gas release. Therefore, it is essential to implement a secondary fire extinguishing
    system and closely monitor for any rekindling - this is not described in the Planning Statement.</p>
<p>As planning regulations and practice is relatively slow to catch up with technological developments, it seems clear
    that there is a lack of effective guidance for planning authorities on large-scale BESS developments.</p>
<p>Similarly, it would appear as though safety legislation and practice also needs to catch up. “Safety of Grid Scale
    Lithium-ion Battery Energy Storage Systems” Fordhamet al., 2021.</p>

<h2>UK Government guidance on Battery Energy Storage Systems</h2>

<p>
    The following is copied from the the UK government website's 
    <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/renewable-and-low-carbon-energy#battery-energy-storage-systems"
        target="_blank">Renewable and low carbon energy guidance</a> section on Battery Energy Storage Systems:
</p>

<p>Electricity storage can enable us to use energy more flexibly and de-carbonise our energy system cost-effectively -
    for example, by helping to balance the system at lower cost, maximising the usable output from intermittent low
    carbon generation (e.g. solar and wind), and deferring or avoiding the need for costly network upgrades and new
    generation capacity.</p>
<p>Paragraph: 032 Reference ID: 5-032-20230814</p>

<h3>What is the planning application process for battery energy storage systems?</h3>
<p>When applying for planning permission for development involving lithium-ion battery energy storage systems these are
    subject to the requirements set out in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/595/contents/made"
        target="_blank">The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England)
        Order 2015.</a></p>
<p>Paragraph: 033 Reference ID: 5-033-20230814</p>
<h3>What can applicants seeking planning permission for battery energy storage systems do to ensure they consider any
    potential risks?</h3>
<p>Where planning permission is being sought for development of battery energy storage systems of 1 MWh or over, and
    excluding where battery energy storage systems are associated with a residential dwelling, applicants are encouraged
    to engage with the relevant local fire and rescue service before submitting an application to the local planning
    authority. This is so matters relating to the siting and location of battery energy storage systems, in particular
    in the event of an incident, prevention of the impact of thermal runway, and emergency services access can be
    considered before an application is made.</p>
<p>Applicants are also encouraged to consider <a
        href="https://www.ukfrs.com/sites/default/files/2023-04/Grid%20Scale%20Battery%20Energy%20Storage%20System%20planning%20Guidance%20for%20FRS.pdf"
        target="_blank">guidance produced by the National Fire Chiefs Council</a> (PDF, 488 KB) when
    preparing the application.</p>
<p>The location of such sites are of particular interest to fire and rescue services; who will seek to obtain details of
    the design, and firefighting access and facilities at these sites in their register of site specific risks that they
    maintain for the purposes of Section 7 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004.</p>
<p>Paragraph: 034 Reference ID: 5-034-20230814</p>
<h3>What can local planning authorities do to ensure they consider any potential risks when determining the planning
    application?</h3>
<p>When planning applications for the development of battery energy storage systems of 1 MWh or over, and excluding
    where battery energy storage systems are associated with a residential dwelling, are submitted to a local planning
    authority, the local planning authority are encouraged to consult with their local fire and rescue service as part
    of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/consultation-and-pre-decision-matters#Public-consultation"
        target="_blank">formal period of public consultation</a> prior to deciding the planning application. This is to
    ensure that the
    fire and rescue service are given the opportunity to provide their views on the application to identify the
    potential mitigations which could be put in place in the event of an incident, and so these views can be taken into
    account when determining the application.</p>
<p>Local planning authorities are also encouraged to consider <a href="https://www.ukfrs.com/sites/default/files/2023-04/Grid%20Scale%20Battery%20Energy%20Storage%20System%20planning%20Guidance%20for%20FRS.pdf" target="_blank">guidance produced by the National Fire Chiefs Council</a> (PDF,
    488 KB) when determining the application.</p>
